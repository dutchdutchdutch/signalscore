# Product Brief: signalscore

## Executive Summary

**SignalScore** is the "Glassdoor for AI Readiness" — a streamlined intelligence tool that empowers job-seekers and employees to instantly evaluate a company's true trajectory in the AI era. In a landscape where AI adoption forces rapid role evolution, employees currently lack reliable metrics to judge whether a company is accelerating or stagnating.

The tool cuts through "AI-washing" marketing/PR by surfacing tangible signals of AI maturity: leadership fluency, experimental cadence, and automated workflows. By simply entering a company URL, users get a clear "AI Readiness Score" and trajectory (Leading, Fast Follower, Trailing, Lagging). This helps individuals hedge their career bets and align their skills with organizations that are successfully keeping pace with agentic transformation.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Job-seekers and employees are flying blind in the AI era. They lack a trusted method to evaluate whether a company is genuinely adapting to AI or merely stagnating, forcing them to rely on incomplete, misleading signals. Employees inside companies have a limited view of the external market, while those on the outside cannot distinguish between "cosmetic AI" marketing and actual operational readiness.

### Problem Impact

Without visibility, professionals risk stagnating in roles that are rapidly depreciating in value. While most companies may survive the next 2-3 years, many *current jobs* will not—they will be displaced or fundamentally altered by AI agents. Professionals unable to "hedge their bets" risk investing time in roles that will vanish, rather than preparing for the new, agentic-augmented roles that forward-thinking companies are creating.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

*   **No "AI Readiness" Equivalent**: Platforms like Glassdoor focus on culture and salary, not technological adaptability.
*   **Unmeasurable Metrics**: There is no current way to gauge critical indicators like "% workflows automated" or "leadership AI fluency" from the outside.
*   **AI-Washing**: Product descriptions and PR often hide the reality, making it impossible to tell if AI is core to the business or just a buzzword wrapper.
*   **Siloed View**: Internal employees lack benchmarks to know if their company’s struggles are normal or a sign of impending failure.

### Proposed Solution

A radically simple lookup tool backed by deep signal analysis.
*   **One-Click Insight**: Users simply enter a company URL to receive an instant "AI Readiness Profile."
*   **Survival Potential Ratings**: Classifying companies as leaders, followers, trailers, or laggers (Buy/Hold/Sell equivalent for careers).
*   **Transparency**: Surfacing hard-to-find metrics on experimentation cadence and leadership fluency.
*   **Career Hedging Tools**: Actionable insights to help users decide whether to invest their time in a company or pivot, and how to upskill for the specific agentic future that company offers.

### Key Differentiators

*   **Career Risk Hedging**: Positioning company analysis not just as "is it a good place to work," but "will this place survive," treating career decisions with the rigour of investment decisions.
*   **Agentic Transformation Focus**: Specifically targeting the shift to agentic workflows, a nuance missed by general tech analysis.
*   **Counter-Signal Detection**: Algorithms designed specifically to pierce through "AI-washing" and identifying cosmetic vs. structural AI adoption.
*   **Zero-Friction UX**: High internal complexity masked by an incredibly simple user interface.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

#### The Career Strategist (Elena)
*   **Profile**: Mid-Senior Software Engineer or Product Manager (~8 years exp).
*   **Context**: Currently employed but feeling stagnant. She sees AI changing her field fast and is looking for her next move, but is terrified of joining a "legacy" ship that is slowly sinking.
*   **Motivation**: Job security through skill relevance. She wants to work where she can learn the tools of the future (Agentic AI), not just maintain legacy code.

**The "Displacement Anxiety" Problem:**
*   **Internal View**: She looks at her current job description and realizes ~40% of her daily tasks could be displaced by agentic workflows today. Yet, her company is doing nothing to structurally evolve processes or redefine roles, leaving her in a vulnerable "wait and see" position.
*   **External View**: She reads job descriptions for companies she used to admire, but now spots "red flags"—lists of responsibilities that will likely be automated away in 6-12 months. It's unclear if the company is hiring for the *future* role or just backfilling a *dying* one.

**Success Vision**:
*   She types in a company URL and instantly sees a "Lagging" score with "0% Agentic Workflow." She saves herself hours of application time and dodges a career bullet. Alternatively, she finds a "Leading" company hiring for "Agent-Augmented" roles, giving her confidence that this role will evolve, not disappear.

### Secondary Users

#### The Company Benchmarker (Marcus, VP Engineering)
*   **Need**: Wants to know how his org is perceived externally compared to competitors. Is he losing talent because they look "behind"?
*   **Value**: Reality check. If his internal "AI Transformation" initiatives aren't showing up as external signals, he knows there's a disconnect.

#### The Internal Auditor (Sarah, Senior Analyst)
*   **Need**: Validation. She feels the company is moving too slow. SignalScore gives her external data to prove it to her boss ("Look, our competitors are 'Fast Followers' and we are 'Trailing')".

### User Journey (Elena's Path)

1.  **Discovery**: Sees a LinkedIn post: "Is the job you're applying for going to exist in a year? Check the company's AI Readiness first."
2.  **Onboarding**: Lands on homepage. No signup. Just a big search bar: "Enter Company URL."
3.  **Core Usage**:
    *   Types `corporation-x.com`.
    *   **Result**: "Status: Trailing."
    *   **Insight**: "Warning: Job descriptions at this company have not evolved since 2023. High risk of role displacement without upskilling support."
    *   **Action**: She closes the job tab for Corporation X.
    *   **Pivot**: She clicks "Show me 'Leading' companies in Fintech" instead.
4.  **Success Moment**: Finds a "Leading" company she hadn't considered, applies, and feels confident she's making a smart career investment.

## Success Metrics

### User Success Metrics
*value = speed-to-confidence that changes behavior*

*   **Decision Conversion Rate (Behavior Change)**
    *   **Goal**: Users take different actions because of SignalScore data.
    *   **Measure**: % of users who report changing listing status (Applied → Skipped, Interviewing → Declined) based on score.
    *   **Target**: >15% of searches lead to a "Negative" decision (avoidance value).
    *   **Gold Standard**: "I almost joined X, this stopped me" testimonials.

*   **Research Time Compression**
    *   **Goal**: Collapse weeks of research into minutes.
    *   **Benchmark**: Candidates spend 8-15 hours researching per serious opportunity.
    *   **Target**: Compress deeper diligence to <30 minutes.
    *   **Measure**: (Self-reported pre-tool time) vs (Session duration + Confidence Score).

*   **Avoidance Value (The "Career Saver" Metric)**
    *   **Goal**: Help users dodge "Legacy Trap" roles.
    *   **Measure**: Estimated Opportunity Cost Saved = (Avg User Salary) × (Avg Tenure at Laggard Co before quitting).
    *   **Outcome**: High volume of "Saved me from a 2-year career detour" user stories.

### Business Objectives
*   **Prediction Accuracy (Trust)**: Post-hire validation—did the AI readiness score match lived experience at 3/6/12 months? Validated via NPS cohort analysis (High-Score company joiners vs Low-Score company joiners).
*   **Signal Quality Intensity**: Maintain high signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   Target: >40% employee verification rate on crowdsourced data points.
    *   Target: High correlation between SignalScore and objective outcomes (e.g., Company layoffs, funding rounds, revenue per employee).

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

*   **Engagement Depth (Serious Evaluation)**: % of users comparing 3+ companies in a single session.
*   **Return Rate**: % of users returning within 6 months (indicating new job search or ongoing monitoring).
*   **Filter Usage**: Ratio of users filtering by specific hard metrics (e.g., "% automated workflows") vs just viewing top-level vanity scores.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features

1.  **Direct Company Lookup (The Hook)**
    *   **Input**: Simple search bar accepting Company URL or Company Name.
    *   **Output**: "AI Readiness Profile" page.
    *   **Requirement**: Must handle 80% of Fortune 2000 companies and top 500 tech startups at launch.

2.  **AI Readiness Scoring System**
    *   **Ranking**: Assigns one of 5 statuses:
        *   🚀 Leading
        *   🏃 Fast Follower
        *   👀 Exploring
        *   🚶 Trailing
        *   🛑 Lagging
    *   **Visuals**: Simple "Speedometer" or "Color Coded Badge" visual for instant comprehension.

3.  **Benchmark Evidence (The "Why")**
    *   **Display**: 3-5 key data points justifying the score (e.g., "0 mentions of AI in 10-K", "No Engineering Blog posts on Agents in 12 months").
    *   **Methodology Modal**: "How we calculate this" explanation accessible from the profile to build trust.

### Out of Scope for MVP

*   **Career Risk Signals**: "Career Risk Assessment" widget deferred to v2. Focus MVP on company readiness, not individual role risk.
*   **User Accounts / Profiles**: No login required. No saving lists. Frictionless access is priority.
*   **Job Board Aggregation**: We link to career sites, we do not scrape and host job listings ourselves (yet).
*   **Crowdsourced Reviews**: No "Glassdoor-style" user reviews or salary data submission in v1. Data is derived from public signals only to ensure initial quality control.
*   **Paid Tiers / B2B Features**: No "Claim your profile" for companies. Pure consumer utility first.

### MVP Success Criteria

*   **Search Success Rate**: <5% of searches result in "Company Not Found."
*   **Understanding**: Users spend >30s on the Methodology page (indicating they care *how* it's calculated).
*   **Shareability**: >10% of users share a company profile link (social proof).

### Future Vision

*   **Crowdsourced Signal Layer**: Verified employees anonymously contributing internal "reality check" data to refine the public score.
*   **Personalized Career Pathing**: Upload your Resume, and we tell you which "Leading" companies match your current stack.
*   **B2B Transformation**: Selling "Readiness Audits" to "Lagging" companies who want to improve their score (and ability to hire talent).
