# SignalScore: Auditing AI Readiness

## WHAT is SignalScore?  

SignalScore is an open-source intelligence engine that quantifies a company’s actual AI adoption and benchmarks its AI readiness. SignalScore is an [active research project](#development-notice-and-forward-looking-information).

SignalScore **measures what companies *do*, not what they *claim***. The system scrapes verifiable external signals: job postings, GitHub contributions  showing agentic orchestration, engineering blogs detailing production LLM infrastructure. Early research shows AI expectations in non-engineering job postings correlate most strongly with genuine transformation.

## WHY SignalScore?  
The next 18–24 months will be defined by Agentic Augmentation, where autonomous systems perform common tasks and enable higher-quality human decisions. **To navigate the Agentic Shift**, leaders need a dual-lens approach. Legacy frameworks remain necessary for auditing *safety* (Infrastructure, Security, Governance). New Dynamic frameworks, like SignalScore to measure operational throughput. 

Legacy assessment frameworks rely on self-reporting  that mostly capture Internal Intent". Predictable result: overestimation. When 75% of knowledge workers use ChatGPT for commodity tasks, internal surveys report "widespread AI adoption" while teams still manually review most outputs, go to the same amount of status meetings, and collaborate per legacy norms, negating automation ROI.

The measurement gap creates strategic blind spots:

* Organizations believe their "AI upskilling mandate" succeeded while many employees see it as extra work  
* Boards approve AI budgets based on inflated capability assessments  
* Leadership mistakes tool deployment for workflow transformation

Companies integrating agentic workflows compress quarterly timelines into weeks. S\&P 500 firms with productivity AI adoption show 29% faster stock price growth than the broader market. Misreading your position is an existential threat.

Direct research prompts surface insights, but without benchmarks you're navigating blind. That's exactly why SignalScore exists.


## WHO Benefits from SingleScore?    
SignalScore separates leaders from laggards in AI Readiness \- **providing decision intelligence for:**

* **Executives:** Audit organizational AI readiness without internal self-assessment bias. Public signals expose gaps between strategy and execution.  
* **Investors:** Validate AI adoption claims during due diligence. A company claiming "AI-powered" with a dated tech stack or zero AI platform engineers is a significant red flag.  
* **Job-Seekers & Employees:** Evaluate if a company's "AI transformation" is real. Job seekers can assess whether a role is forward-looking or AI-vulnerable, while current employees can benchmark their employer against competitors to assess career risk.

The stakes: Organizations scoring above 80 (Leading) achieve 2.8x faster product release cycles. Employees at firms scoring  below 60 (Trailing) face 18-24 month skill obsolescence and 29% wage penalties. SignalScore provides the data to choose acceleration over stagnation.

## HOW  SingleScore measures  AI Readiness measured

The SignalScore architecture operates on the premise that genuine technological shifts leave a digital trail. The model uses autonomous discovery agents to crawl public digital artifacts, aggregating data across five weighted categories to calculate a "Kinetic Energy" score. Results are normalized against a "Ground Truth" dataset of verified AI-forward firms (e.g., Google, Shopify).

### The Five Core Signals (0–100 Rating):

1. **AI Keywords (25%):** Analyzes semantic density, distinguishing generic buzzwords from technical specificity (e.g., "Generative AI" vs. "Transformer Architecture").  
2. **Agentic Signals (20%):** The most forward-looking metric, hunting for the vocabulary of the *next* phase of AI: "Orchestration," "Self-healing," and "Multi-agent workflows." This detects movement toward Agentic flows.  
3. **Non-Engineering Roles (25%):** A critical differentiator, scanning for AI adoption in departments like Finance, HR, and Marketing. High scores here indicate Systemic adoption (Gartner Level 4), not isolated R\&D.  
4. **Tool Stack (20%):** Identifies the "Tools of the Trade" by scraping engineering blogs and job requirements. Presence of libraries like LangChain, PyTorch, or vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate) proxies technical modernization.  
5. **AI Platform Team (10%):** Validates the existence of "Acceleration Engineers" or dedicated platform teams, confirming the company is building the "Legibility Layer" required for agents to function on internal data.

#### Verification and Bonuses  
To mitigate "AI-washing" risk, source verifiability is weighted: a claim on a "Homepage" is weighted at **0.5x**, while evidence from a GitHub repository or ATS-integrated Job Description is weighted at **2.0x** (Hard Evidence). Additionally, raw category scores are amplified for exceptional depth: a **\+10 Bonus** is awarded if two or more categories score  above 90\.

### SignalScore Readiness Tiers

| Score Range | Category | What It Means |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **95–100** | **Transformational** | Industry-defining AI adoption; agentic workflows in production, AI embedded widely across non-engineering functions. |
| **80–94** | **Leading** | Strong public signals; dedicated AI platform teams, modern tooling, and AI adoption in non-engineering functions. |
| **60–79** | **On Par** | Operational AI presence; actively hiring AI roles, some tool adoption, limited agentic signals. |
| **30–59** | **Trailing** | Early exploration; AI keywords in job posts, but no platform team or systematic deployment. |
| **0–29** | **Lagging** | Minimal public AI activity; homepage mentions AI, but zero engineering evidence. |

**Limitations**

* **Public Signal Dependency:** Private companies with closed GitHub repos may score lower than justified.  
* **Industry Variance:** Regulated sectors (finance, healthcare) with limited public disclosure can create false negatives.  
* **Time Lag:** Structural changes may manifest 6–12 months before being reflected in public signals.  
* *Note: SignalScore allows for direct URL submission to rescore a company.*

## HOW Does SignalScore compare?  

| Framework | What it Evaluates | Assessment Type | Accessibility from Outside |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Cisco AI Readiness Index** | 6 pillars: Strategy, Infrastructure, Data, Governance, Talent, Culture. | Self-Evaluation (Survey-based). | Highly Accessible; free online diagnostic tool. |
| **Microsoft AI Assessment** | 5 drivers of value (Strategy, Culture, Governance) & Cloud Adoption stages. | Self-Evaluation (Wizard) / Hybrid implementation. | Highly Accessible (Wizard); Technical documentation is public. |
| **Deloitte AI Maturity Models** | Strategy, Data, Tech, Culture, Outcomes, and Applied Trust. | Consultant Assessment (High-touch). | Limited; requires engagement. |
| **Gartner AI Maturity Model** | 5 levels of development across 7 organizational pillars. | Analyst Assessment / Subscriber Toolkit. | Low; restricted to Gartner clients. |
| **SignalScore** | 5 weighted public signals: AI Keywords, Agentic Signals, Tool Stack, Non-Eng Roles, AI Platform Team. | Automated External Scraping (Objective/Hard Evidence). | Instant; Open Source web app. |

### DO The Dual Mandate: Defense and Offense

The established consulting frameworks are designed to measure compliance and foundation. SignalScore is the survival tool designed to measure *speed*. You must actively track the **"Kinetic Energy"** of your AI adoption to avoid being rendered obsolete.

1. **Use Big Firm Models (Cisco/Gartner) for Defense:** Ensure your foundation (Infrastructure, Security, Governance) is compliant and scalable.  
2. **Use SignalScore for Offense:** Audit your *actual* market posture. Run it against your own public footprint.  
3. **Self-Correct:** If your internal Gartner assessment says you are "Level 4 (Systemic)" but your SignalScore is "35 (Trailing)," you have a **"Marketing-Reality Gap"** ;you are likely talking about AI more than you are leveraging it.*
