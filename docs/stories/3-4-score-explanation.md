# Story 3.4: Improve Category Breakdown UX

## Story

As a **User**,
I want **to see the signal score calculation**,
so that **I understand how the score is calculated and what it means**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [1 ] **AC1: [Partial Scores should add up to ]**
  - [Currently the partial scores do not add up to the total score]. fix this by multiplying the caterogoty score by  weight of the score. diaply the category score x the weight and the result contributing to the total score.

- [2 ] **AC2: [Non_eng_ai ]**
  - the 4th category is displayed by its system label non_eng_ai. change this to "AI in Non-Engineering Roles". 

- [3 ] **AC3: [remove "progress bar" ]**
  - Each category has a white or gray bar at the bottom, the meaning is unclear and should be removed. 

  - [4 ] **AC4: Clarify scoring scale ]**
  - Either in header in each block indicate that each category can score between 0 and 100 (unweighted)

  - [5 ] **AC5: Section subehader update ]**
  - Scores derive from public data: job postings, blog posts, public repos, news. Internal reality may differ.
