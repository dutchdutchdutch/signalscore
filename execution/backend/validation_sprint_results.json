Our customers range from hours-old startups to complex global businesses. Collectively, they are growing the GDP of the internet. You can help. Hear from our leadership Watch video We focus on the details of everything we do, so businesses around the world can focus on what\u2019s most important to them. So Ford can focus on building a global digital dealership , rather than processing payments. So Le Monde can expand its digital offering globally , not reinvent subscription billing. So truckers can focus on getting supply chains moving , not invoicing paper trails.

We\u2019re still in the early stages of our growth and many of our biggest challenges lie ahead. You might think that Stripe has things figured out. While we\u2019re proud of what we\u2019ve built so far, we spend our time thinking about everything we haven\u2019t done yet. Planning means sacrifice: we have great ambitions but limited resources over short time horizons. We are happy that we can support more than 50 payment methods (and accelerate rollout of new ones), incorporate more than 20,000 startups , and galvanize responses to climate change . But every quarter there are many important projects we want to undertake, but can\u2019t. 20 min read A guide to payment methods Read on stripe.com 3 min read Stripe Atlas: the first five years and 20,000 startups Read on stripe.com/blog 2 min read Stripe is paying companies to pull carbon out of the atmosphere Read on fastcompany.com The stack that got us here won\u2019t get us there.

This motivates us to bring in people like you\u2014people who have knowledge and experiences we don\u2019t, and who can quickly bring their talents to bear on hard problems. Stripe is not a pay-your-dues culture; we will train you quickly and then give you substantial responsibility. We often have surprisingly small teams accomplish strikingly important work. The pace of change and velocity of the product force you to pick up new skills, experiment with new tactics, and walk in a variety of users\u2019 shoes. We have to be able to build things quickly to support the fastest growing startups and platforms in the world, while also being reliable, trustworthy, and sometimes profoundly boring. We need to get projects done today, while building infrastructure that the internet will rely upon for decades . We also need to balance an intense work environment against the need to support fulfilling and sustainable careers. 9 min read Stripe: Platform of Platforms Read on stratechery.com 10 min read Stripe: Thinking Like a Civilization Read on readthegeneralist.com 10 min read What Working At Stripe Has Been Like Read on kalzumeus.com Stripe is a team, not a place. We have two headquarters (San Francisco and Dublin), but we belong to the internet. We speak more than 30 languages with our customers and even more with our families. More than 8,000 Stripes build products and support our users from offices in Amsterdam, Bangalore, Barcelona, Berlin, Chicago, Dubai, Dublin, Hyderabad, London, Melbourne, Mexico City, New York, Paris, Prague, S\u00e3o Paulo, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney, Tallinn, Tokyo, Toronto, Warsaw, and Zurich\u2014as well as all the homes and coworking spaces of our remote colleagues . We aspire to make internet payments as ubiquitous and effortless as email. This isn\u2019t simply a matter of ignoring borders; it also requires respectful dialogue with governments, embracing cultural differences, and building products that work in local contexts. That\u2019s why we try to be physically close to our users, too. We want to share cabs with them in Singapore and buy food together in the darshinis of Bangalore. We are grappling with the challenges of operating at an organizational scale that few tech companies reach. We care about our culture and want to preserve the important parts while evolving to meet the needs of new Stripes and our changing business context. We continuously listen to our employees to understand where Stripe truly excels and listen for opportunities to further enhance the way we work as a company and as individuals. I can see the relationship between what I do and the overall mission and priorities of Stripe I feel connected to my team Stripe is in a position to be successful over the next three years My location is not a barrier to my having an impact at Stripe Favorable Neutral Unfavorable Many companies can offer you attractive benefits and compensation. We offer that plus something a bit rarer: the opportunity to work with speed and agility on a platform that has an impact across the entire internet. When you start at Stripe you will go through at least two weeks of in-depth onboarding. We will pair you with experienced team members to show you the ropes. And then you learn by doing. It is common for Stripes to work on things outside their domain of expertise, so we encourage people to regularly attend hands-on classes led by internal and external experts on everything from Learning to Code to Thinking Like a Lawyer. 33 min podcast SaaStr Podcast: Claire Hughes Johnson, COO @ Stripe Listen on saastr.com 4 min read How Stripe teaches employees to code Read on stripe.com/blog Q Kuhns, Internal Communications Before joining the Internal Communications team at Stripe, I headed up a forensic anthropology lab. Stripe is much more lively. Sarah Heck, New Markets Before joining the Entrepreneurship team at Stripe, I was responsible for entrepreneurship, youth, and global civilian outreach policy for the National Security Council. Valerie Williams, Inclusion and Diversity Before joining the People team at Stripe, I had a career in supply chain management. Alia Gurtov, Deployment Strategist Before joining the User Ops team at Stripe and discovering solutions for our users, I worked as a paleoanthropologist and discovered a new hominin species. Meka Asonye, New Business Before joining the Startup & SMB Sales team at Stripe, I managed development and operations for a major league baseball team. Catherine David, Connect Accounts Prior to joining the Connect Accounts team at Stripe, I worked in a physics lab building a system to do quantum measurement and fast-reset of superconducting qubits. Joe Moon, Dashboard Platform Before joining the Dashboard Platform team at Stripe, I served as an Infantry Rifleman in the United States Marine Corps. I served in Iraq and the West Pacific. Jaclyn Schoof, Payments Infrastructure Before joining the Payments team at Stripe, I handled crisis intervention in a group home for teenage girls reintegrating from the Juvenile Justice System. David Edelson, Technical Operations Before joining the User Ops team at Stripe, I worked my way up from Cashier to maintaining the codebase as Operations Manager at an independent bookstore chain in NYC. I built everything from bookcases to their very own point of sale system. Eirini Asprouda, Special Handling Specialization Before joining the User Ops team, I worked as an architect designing things like the masterplan for Chicago as a candidate city for the Olympic Games and pedestrian bridges in Dubai. Stripes come from all sorts of professional backgrounds like engineering, design, operations, consulting, government, finance, healthcare, and education. We strive for humility as individuals and as an organization. We know that we can do great things alone, but even greater things together. We have a transparent internal culture. If you are curious about engineering, running startups, corporate strategy, or the global economy, you\u2019ll have experts to learn from. And they\u2019ll be eager to learn from you. There is no magic to working with banking partners in Japan, moving billions of dollars around the world, or pushing the limits of browser animations on our product pages. We have smart people who sweat the details\u2014who start with a blank screen, work until a product is ready, and polish until it is exceptional. You will be able to point to specific, high-impact things that didn\u2019t exist until you created them. Everyone at Stripe thinks about creating the best user experience first, then works backward from there. You came to this page for a reason. Now we hope you\u2019ll take the next step and come talk to us about whether one of our open roles is a good fit. We\u2019re hiring talented people like you all the time. We hope you\u2019re next. Do your best work among people who support, refine, and amplify every piece of it. Stripe hosts undergraduate and graduate interns from around the globe. We have an opinionated set of principles, and we\u2019re happy to be warts-and-all honest about them. We embrace diverse perspectives, ideas, and backgrounds at Stripe. We\u2019re committed to providing equal employme",
